MACHINE LEARNING FOR PREDICTIVE DISABILITIES ANALYSIS

## Methods

### 1. Data Gathering
The initial phase of the project focuses on collecting a diverse and comprehensive dataset relevant to dyslexia, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia. The key steps include:

- **Data Sources**: Acquire data from multiple sources such as medical records, genetic information, lifestyle factors, and environmental influences.
- **Preprocessing**: Ensure the dataset's uniformity and compatibility by handling missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical variables. This preprocessing step is crucial for effective analysis and model training.

### 2. Modeling
In this phase, various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are implemented to train predictive models. The algorithms explored include:

- **Decision Tree**: A tree-based model that splits the data into subsets based on the most significant attributes.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control overfitting.
- **Random Forest with Grid Search (GS) Optimization**: Enhances the random forest model by tuning hyperparameters to find the optimal combination for the best performance.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classification method that finds the hyperplane that best separates the data into classes.
- **SVM with GS Optimization**: Fine-tunes the SVM model by performing a grid search to optimize hyperparameters for better results.

### 3. Prediction
The predictive performance of each ML model is evaluated based on several metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances.
- **Precision**: Evaluates the number of true positive predictions relative to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: Assesses the number of true positive predictions relative to the total actual positives.

The best-performing model, based on these metrics, is selected for the final application.

### 4. Application Development
An application is developed to showcase the functionality and effectiveness of the selected predictive model. This application:

- **User Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for healthcare professionals to input relevant data and obtain predictive insights.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Performs predictions in real-time, offering immediate insights for early detection and proactive management of dyslexia, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia.

### 5. Model Interpretability and Transparency
To ensure the practical integration of ML models into clinical practice, the project emphasizes:

- **Model Interpretability**: Developing interpretable models that provide clear insights into the reasoning behind their predictions.
- **Transparency**: Ensuring healthcare professionals can understand and trust the decisions made by the ML algorithms.

### 6. Interdisciplinary Collaboration
The project involves collaboration between researchers, clinicians, educators, and policymakers to address:

- **Data Quality**: Ensuring high-quality, diverse datasets.
- **Model Generalization**: Developing models that generalize well to different populations and settings.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Ensuring responsible and ethical development and deployment of predictive analytics solutions.
